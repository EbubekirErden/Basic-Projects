# School-Projects
## Ant Colony Optimization
- For CMPE 160 Introduction to OOP class (Spring 2024)
- Uses OOP in Java with a heuristic algorithm
- Implements the Ant Colony Optimization solution to well-known Travelling Salesman Problem
- Also shows the difference between heuristic algorithm and permutation brute force
## Turkey Map 
- For CMPE 160 Introduction to OOP class (Spring 2024)
- Uses OOP in Java with Dijkstra Algorithm and basic graph mecanics
- Draws all given roads in a Turkey map with StdDraw library and finds the shortest path between given two cities
## Truck Fleet Optimization
- For CMPE 250 Data Structures and Algorithms class (Fall 2025)
- Uses various data structures such as Hashtable, Linkedlist, Stack, Queue, AVL Binary Tree and OOP in Java
- Optimizes loads for various ID'd trucks and sorts them to have a reach to closest loaded trucks
## Instagram Feed
- For CMPE 250 Data Structures and Algorithms class (Fall 2025)
- Uses various data structures such as Hashmap, Hashtable, Stack, Heap and OOP in Java
- Similar to Instagram feed, through file input-output, it generates and keep track of posts, users, followers, likes, and a feed
## Magical Map
- For CMPE 250 Data Structures and Algorithms class (Fall 2025)
- Uses various data structures such as Graph, PriorityQueue, HashSet, HashMap, Queue, Stack and OOP in Java
- A more complex shortest path algorithm
- We have known and will be discovered obstacles and so we dynamically update our shortest path and change the optimal type of obstacles to passable before going to another target
